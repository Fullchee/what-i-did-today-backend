## MIT (Most Important Tasks for today)

- 1-3 MIT (for the day)
- pick from the unfinished list
  - only in these states: (not started, working)
- sort by earliest to latest
- goal: get to this status by today
- why didn't you complete yesterday's MIT?
  - what got in the way?

## Weekly reporting
